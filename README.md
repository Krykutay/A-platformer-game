This is a mini game version of what I've been enjoying to create lately. The actual game is leaning toward a platformer game with puzzles and such whereas this one is basically a "skeleton farming simulator" with a main character, enemies and npcs. Oh and yellow dude sells some cool stuff, don't miss it!
